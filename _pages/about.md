I am a Ph.D. candidate, advised by Professor [Kyoobin Lee](https://ailab.gist.ac.kr/), at the School of Integrated Technology (Robotics Program), [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)](https://www.gist.ac.kr/), South Korea. I received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from GIST, South Korea in 2018.

My research interests are in *deep learning for robotic manipulation*. In particular, I focused on the robotic perception and manipulation of unseen objects with deep neural networks and Sim2Real transfer. I have integrated the robot and vision systems for robotic furniture assembly from IKEA instruction and robotic assembly in an unstructured environment. My research topic also includes the health care application of deep learning in biomedical signals and image domain.
