I am a Ph.D. candidate, advised by Professor [Kyoobin Lee](https://ailab.gist.ac.kr/), at the School of Integrated Technology (Robotics Program), [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)](https://www.gist.ac.kr/), South Korea. I received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from GIST, South Korea in 2018.

My research interests are in *robot vision for unseen object manipulation*. I focused on the robotic perception and manipulation of unseen objects via deep neural networks and Sim2Real transfer. I have developed and integrated various robotic systems, such as [vision-based grasping](https://github.com/gist-ailab/deep-grasping), [furniture assembly from IKEA instruction](https://youtu.be/tPClgvj45vk), and [human-robot collaboration in an unstructured environment]().Â My research topic also includes the health care application of deep learning in biomedical signals and the image domain.
